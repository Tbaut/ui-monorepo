#### **`packages/files-ui`**

The UI for Chainsafe Files

## Development

Requirements: 
- Node > 12
- Yarn > 1

## Run
- Run `yarn` at the root to install all project dependencies
- Run `yarn start:storybook` to start the component storybook  
  OR
- Create a `packages/files-ui/.env` based on `packages/files-ui/.env.example`
- Run `yarn start:files-ui` to start the development server.

## Run Tests

Our tests use Cypress running against the local instance of the Files UI. The files UI needs to run **before** the test are launched.
By default the tests are run against `localhost:3000`

- To start the tests UI run `yarn test:files-ui`
- To start all the tests like in CI run `yarn test:ci:files-ui`
